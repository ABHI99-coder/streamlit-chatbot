      "Ludo Ludo's origins trace back to the ancient Indian game Pachisi, played as early as the 6th century. The modern version was patented in England in 1896. The game's simple design has made it a staple in households worldwide, with countless variations including Parcheesi in the United States and Mensch ärgere Dich nicht in Germany. Monopoly Originally created as \"The Landlord's Game\" by Elizabeth Magie in 1903 to demonstrate the negative aspects of monopolies, the game was later modified and patented by Charles Darrow in 1935. Parker Brothers (now Hasbro) purchased the rights and turned it into the world's best-selling commercial board game. Over 275 million games have been sold worldwide. Chess Chess evolved from the Indian game chaturanga around the 6th century, spreading to Persia and then Europe. The modern rules were standardized in the 19th century. Chess is recognized as a sport by the International Olympic Committee and has been the subject of significant computer science research, culminating in computers like Deep Blue defeating world champions. Checkers One of the oldest known board games, archaeological evidence suggests similar games were played as far back as 3000 BCE in ancient Mesopotamia. The modern version emerged in France around the 12th century. In 2007, checkers was \"solved\" by computer scientists, proving that perfect play by both sides leads to a draw. Clue Created by Anthony E. Pratt in Birmingham, England during World War II and patented in 1947, Clue was inspired by murder mystery dinner parties.
